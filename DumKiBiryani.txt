NOTES
1. Using basmati rice while making biryani makes the biryani very delicious.
2. Always soak the rice when the period of chicken marination is about to complete.
3. Start boiling rice for water when rice has been soaked for about ten minutes.
4. Do not cook the rice for a long time as the rice becomes soggy while giving dum.
5. The longer the time of marination, the more tastier the chicken would turn out.
6. If one is looking for more spicy flavor then the spices can be added more in quantity or can be reduced if less spicy flavor is required.
7. Using fresh herbs gives wonderful fragrance to the biryani.
8. Always check the salt taste while cooking rice, else the biryani would not get the required taste.
9. Another way of giving dum is, the cooking pot should be placed on a high flame and then simmer the flame and place a tawa/griddle below the cooking pot and dum for about 35 minutes. 
10. Placing a tawa below the cooking vessel prevents the base of the cooking vessel from burning.
